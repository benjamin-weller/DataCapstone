    "# Background\n",
    "**You're a trader at RBC.** Using your economics background you think about your favourite resturaunts that you've eaten at through out the city. Why did you like those resturaunts, why not others? Was it that you really like their food; or is it that you like the neighborhood, that the existance of other options when you initial ate there lured you in and you had one single enjoyable experience? Your background tells you that more options is good, that it yields higher consumer surplus numbers, and that obviously a neighborhood with more options will yield better experiences for the people who eat there. **You think that neighborhoods with more resturaunts will have higher satisfaction ratings.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your psychology focused \"performance coach\" disagrees.** They belive that in tight urban dining districts the paradox of choice kicks in. In such situations they belive that often people will have a hard time picking someplace to eat, and when they do, they aren't as satisfied as they would be with a more paired down set of options. **Your performance coach thinks that neighborhoods with a smaller set of resturaunts will unltimately have higher statisfaction numbers.**"

    "It would appear that the results are fairly conculsive. It can be said that the total number of resturaunts in a post code will result in ~60% of the variation in the average number of likes for a resturaunt in that post code. While there is a significatnt cluster of points at the low end (~0,~0), but I believe that the trend line is clear that there is a correlation. While there is a correlation I wouldn't say it's very strong, I believe that there is more variable data that would have to be taken in to account to reach a stronger correlation."

    "\n",
    "It can be said that the data supports the hypothesis that more resturants in a post code does indeed correlate with a higher amount of average likes in that post code. You (our RBC stock trader) can now gently nudge your preformance coach (gently becuase there's still ~40% of the variation that needs to be accounted for), feel free to let your coach know that sometimes the \"sullen science\" (ecomomics) will trump the mind (psychology)."
